<h3> Convex Hull (due 27 Sep 2019) </h3>
<p>
A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that will enclose a
set of points. In a convex polygon a line joining any two points
in the polygon will lie completely within the polygon. One way to
visualize a convex hull is as follows: imagine there are nails
sticking out over the distribution of points. Place a rubber band 
such that it encircles all the nails. The figure described by the
rubber band is a convex hull.

<p>
<b>Input: </b> The input will be a file called <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/points.txt">
points.txt</a>. The first line will be a single integer <i>n</i> denoting 
the number of points, where <i>n</i> will be in the range 3 to 100 inclusive.
It will be followed by <i>n</i> lines of data. Each line will have the x 
and y coordinates of a point. The coordinates of the points will be integers 
in the range (-200, 200). 
</p>

<p>
<b>Output: </b> For the input file given you will print the vertices of 
the convex hull starting at the extreme left point and going clockwise
around the convex hull. The output for this input file is: <br>

<p>
There are many algorithms for solving the convex hull problem. You
will have to implement the <i>Graham's scan</i> algorithm that is
of order O(n log n). The algorithm is given to you in pseudo code.
</p>

<p>
</p><pre>Input: A set of point objects in the x-y plane.

Output: A list of point objects that define the vertices of the convex
        hull in clockwise order.

1.  Sort the points by x-coordinates resulting in a sorted sequence
    p1 ... pn.

2.  Create an empty list <i>upper_hull</i> that will store the vertices
    in the upper hull.

3.  Append the first two points p1 and p2 in order into the upper_hull.

4.  For i going from 3 to n 

5.    Append pi to upper_hull.

6.    While upper_hull contains three or more points and the last three
      points in upper_hull do not make a right turn do

7.      Delete the middle of the last three points from upper_hull

8.  Create an empty list <i>lower_hull</i> that will store the vertices
    in the lower hull.

9.  Append the last two points pn and pn-1 in order into lower_hull with
    pn as the first point.

10. For i going from n - 2 downto 1

11.   Append pi to lower_hull

12.   While lower_hull contains three or more points and the last three
      points in the lower_hull do not make a right turn do

13.     Delete the middle of the last three points from lower_hull

14. Remove the first and last points for lower_hull to avoid duplication
    with points in the upper hull.

15. Append lower_hull to upper_hull and call it the convex_hull

16. Return the convex_hull.

<p>
Two points p (px, py) and q (qx, qy) define a straight line. If add a
third point r (rx, ry) how do you know whether r is to the right or
left of the line defined by p and q. There is a simple solution to it.
Evaluate the following determinant:
</p><pre>1   px   py
1   qx   qy
1   rx   ry
</pre>
If the determinant is zero then the three points are in a straight line.
The sign of the determinant will decide if the point is to the right or
left of the line. Find that for yourself.
<p></p>

<p>
The computation of the area of a polygon given its vertices involves
computing another determinant. If the vertices of a polygon are given
by [p1, p2, ..., pn] where n is greater than or equal to 3, then 
compute the determinant given by the coordinates of the vertices:
</p><pre>x1  y1
x2  y2
..  ..
xn  yn

det = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y3 + ... + xn * y1 - y1 * x2 - y2 * x3 - ... - yn * x1)

area = (1/2) * abs (det)
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You must follow the template of the code given. You may not change the
function signature but you may always add helper functions as needed.
