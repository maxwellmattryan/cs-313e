<h3> Greatest Path Sum in a Grid ( Due 11 Oct 2019 ) </h3>
<p>
Assume that you have square grid of positive integers. You want
to start at the top left corner in the grid and work your way
down to the bottom right corner. The contraint that you have is
that you can only move either to the right or down from your current 
position in the grid. You want to take the path that gives you 
the greatest sum.
</p>

<p>
<b>Input: </b><br>
You will be given a file called <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grid.txt">grid.txt</a>.
The first line in this file will be the dimension <i>n</i> of this 
square grid. The dimension of the grid will be between 1 and 12 
inclusive. It will be followed by <i>n</i> lines of data. Each line
will have <i>n</i> positive integers between 1 and 99 inclusive.
</p>

<p>
<b>Output: </b><br>
First you will output the total number of paths in the grid and then 
you will output the greatest path sum in the grid. You do NOT have to 
output the actual path. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Extra Credit: </b><br>
If you do give us the actual path taken then we will give you 10 points
extra. We are assuming that you will be keeping the numbers contributing
to the greatest path sum in a list. In your output print the list in
the format shown below. If there is more than one path that adds to the
greatest path sum then giving us any one of them is sufficient.
</p><pre>Actual path is [8, ..., 45]
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Here is the template of the code:
</p><pre># counts all the possible paths in a grid recursively
def count_paths (n, row, col):

# recursively gets the greatest sum of all the paths in the grid
def path_sum (grid, n, row, col):

def main():
  # open file for reading
  in_file = open ("./grid.txt", "r")

  # read the dimension of the grid
  dim = in_file.readline()
  dim = dim.strip()
  dim = int(dim)

  # create an empty grid
  grid = []

  # populate the grid
  for i in range (dim):
    line = in_file.readline()
    line = line.strip()
    row = line.split()
    for j in range (dim):
      row[j] = int (row[j])
    grid.append (row)

  # close the file
  in_file.close()

  # get the number of paths in the grid and print
  num_paths = count_paths (dim, 0, 0)
  print ('Number of paths in a grid of dimension', dim, 'is', num_paths)
  print ()

  # get the maximum path sum and print
  max_path_sum = path_sum (grid, dim, 0, 0)
  print ('Greatest path sum is', max_path_sum)

main()
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
For this assignment you are asked to write two recursive functions
<i>count_paths()</i> and <i>path_sum</i>. You may not change the
function signatures. You may add any helper functions that you
may need. For the test grid, the sample output will look like:
</p><pre>Number of paths in a grid of dimension 10 is 48620 

Greatest path sum is 1117

</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
For this assignment you may work with a partner. Both of you
must read the paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf">
Pair Programming. </a>.
</p>

<p>
The file that you will be uploading will be called <b>Grid.py</b>. 
We are looking for clean and structured design. The file will have 
a header of the following form:
</p><pre>#  File: Grid.py

#  Description:

#  Student Name:

#  Student UT EID:

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting the same
program but make sure that you have your partner's name and eid in your 
program. If you are working alone, then remove the two lines that has the 
partner's name and eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to submit 
your <b>Grid.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Friday, 11 Oct 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
</ul>
