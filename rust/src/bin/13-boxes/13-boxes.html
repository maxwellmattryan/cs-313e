<h3> Nesting Boxes ( Due 18 Oct 2019 ) </h3>
<p>
Imagine a room full of boxes. Each box has a length, width, and
height. Since the boxes can be rotated those terms are inter-
changeable. The dimensions are integral values in a consistent
system of units. The boxes have rectangular surfaces and can be
nested inside each other. A box can nest inside another box if
all its dimensions are strictly less than the corresponding
dimensions of the other. You may only nest a box such that the
corresponding surfaces are parallel to each other. A box may
not be nested along the diagonal. You cannot also put two or
more boxes side by side inside another box.
</p>

<p>
The list of boxes is given in a file called <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/boxes.txt">
boxes.txt</a>. The first line gives the number of boxes <i>n</i>. The
next <i>n</i> lines gives a set of three integers separated by one
or more spaces. These integers represent the 3 dimensions of a box.
Since you can rotate the boxes, the order of the dimensions does not
matter. It may be to your advantage to sort the dimensions in
ascending order.
</p>

<p>
The output of your code will be the largest subset of boxes that nest
inside each other starting with the inner most box to the outer most
box. There should be one line for each box.
</p>

<pre>Largest Subset of Nesting Boxes
(2, 2, 3)
(3, 4, 4)
(5, 5, 6)
(6, 7, 9)
</pre>

<p>
If there is two or more subsets of equal lengths that qualify as being
the largest subset, then print all the largest qualifying subsets with
a one line space between each subset. The minimum number of boxes that
qualify as nesting is 2. If there are no boxes that nest in another,
then write "No Nesting Boxes" instead of "Largest Subset of Nesting
Boxes".
</p>

<p>
For the data set that has been given to you, here is the
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/boxes.out"> solution set</a>.
</p>

<p>
For this assignment you may work with a partner. Both of you
must read the paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf">
Pair Programming. </a>.
</p>

<p>
The file that you will be turning in will be called <b> Boxes.py</b>.
We are looking for clean and structured design. The file will have a 
header of the following form:
</p><pre>#  File: Boxes.py

#  Description:

#  Student Name:

#  Student UT EID:

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:

</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting the same
program (from both accounts) but make sure that you have your partner's
name and eid in your program. If you are working alone, then remove the
two lines that has the partner's name and eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>Boxes.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Friday, 18 Oct 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
</ul>
