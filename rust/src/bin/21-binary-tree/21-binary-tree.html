<h3> Binary Trees ( Due 22 Nov 2019 ) </h3>
<p>
In this assignment you will be adding to the classes Node and
Tree that we developed in class and testing them. There are
several short methods that you will have to write. 
</p>

<p>
Write a method <i>is_similar()</i> that takes as input two binary trees
and returns true if the nodes have the same key values and are arranged
in the same order and false otherwise.
</p><pre>def is_similar (self, pNode):
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Write a method <i>print_level()</i> that takes as input the <i>level</i>
and prints out all the nodes at that level. If that level does not exist
for that binary search tree it prints nothing. Use the convention that the
root is at level 1.
</p><pre>def print_level (self, level):
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Write a method <i>get_height()</i> that returns the height of a binary
tree. Recall that the height of a tree is the longest path length
from the root to a leaf.
</p><pre>def get_height (self):
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Write a method <i>num_nodes()</i> that returns the number of nodes in
the left subtree from the root and the number of nodes in the right
subtree from the root and the root itself. This function will be useful 
to determine if the tree is balanced.
</p><pre>def num_nodes (self):
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
In this assignment you will be writing helper methods for the Tree
class that we developed and test them. The following is the outline of 
the code that you will be submitting. You may include the other
functions that we developed for completeness.
</p>

<pre>class Node (object):
  ...

class Tree (object):
  # Returns true if two binary trees are similar
  def is_similar (self, pNode):

  # Prints out all nodes at the given level
  def print_level (self, level): 

  # Returns the height of the tree
  def get_height (self): 

  # Returns the number of nodes in the left subtree and
  # the number of nodes in the right subtree and the root
  def num_nodes (self):

def main():
    # Create three trees - two are the same and the third is different

    # Test your method is_similar()

    # Print the various levels of two of the trees that are different

    # Get the height of the two trees that are different

    # Get the total numbe of nodes a binary search tree

</pre>

<p>
In the class TestBinaryTree you will create several trees and show 
convincingly that your methods are working. For example you can
create a tree by inserting the following integers in this order:
50, 30, 70, 10, 40, 60, 80, 7, 25, 38, 47, 58, 65, 77, 96. There should
be enough documentation in your code that explains to the student
assistants what you are testing and how.
</p>

<p>
The file that you will be turning in will be called <b>TestBinaryTree.py</b>. 
The file will have a header of the following form:
</p><pre>#  File: TestBinaryTree.py

#  Description:

#  Student Name:

#  Student UT EID:

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:
</pre>
For this assignment you may work with a partner. If you do, both of you
must read the paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf"> Pair
Programming </a> and submit the <b>same</b> copy of the program but
make sure that you have your partner's name and eid in your program.
If you are doing this assignment by yourself, then remove the 
<i>Partner Name</i> and <i> Partner UT EID</i> from the header. 
<p></p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>TestBinaryTree.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Friday, 22 Nov 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run before submission on the command line. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
</ul>
