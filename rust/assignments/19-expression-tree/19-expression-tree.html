<h3> Expression Tree ( Due 15 Nov 2019 ) </h3>
<p>
For this assignment you will read a file <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/expression.txt">
expression.txt</a> and create an expression tree. The expression will
be a valid infix expression with the all the necessary parentheses so
that there is no ambiguity in the order of the expression. You will
evaluate the expression and print the result. You will also write the
prefix and postfix versions of the same expression without any
parentheses.
</p>

<p>
In an expression tree the nodes are either operators or operands.
The operators will be in the set ['+', '-', '*', '/', '//', '%', '**']. 
The operands will be either integers or floating point numbers. All the 
operand nodes will be leaves of the expression tree. All the operator 
nodes will have exactly two children.
</p>

<p>
The outline of your program will be as follows:
</p><pre>class Stack (object):

class Node (object):

class Tree (object):
  def __init__ (self):

  def create_tree (self, expr):

  def evaluate (self, aNode):

  def pre_order (self, aNode):

  def post_order (self, aNode):

def main():

main()
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The function <i>create_tree()</i> will take as input parameter an
infix expression with parentheses as a String and create an 
Expression Tree from it. <i>Assume that the expression string is
valid.</i>
</p>

<p>
You will take the expression string and break it into tokens. 
There are four different kinds of tokens - left parenthesis, 
right parenthesis, operator, and operand. When we read a left 
parenthesis we are starting a new expression and when we read 
a right parenthesis we are ending an expression. Here is the 
algorithm that you will use:
</p><ol>
<li> If the current token is a left parenthesis add a new node
as the left child of the current node. Push current node on the
stack and make current node equal to the left child. </li>
<li> If the current token is an operator set the current node's
data value to the operator. Push current node on the stack. Add 
a new node as the right child of the current node and make the 
current node equal to the right child. </li>
<li> If the current token is an operand, set the current node's
data value to the operand and make the current node equal to the 
parent by popping the stack. </li>
<li> If the current token is a right parenthesis make the current
node equal to the parent node by popping the stack <i>if it is 
not empty</i>. </li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>
For the input expression, this is what your program will output:
</p><pre>( ( 8 + 3 ) * ( 7 - 2 ) ) = 55

Prefix Expression: * + 8 3 - 7 2

Postfix Expression: 8 3 + 7 2 - *
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The file that you will be submitting will be called <b>ExpressionTree.py</b>. 
We will be looking for good documentation, descriptive variable names, 
clean logical structure, and adherence to the coding conventions discussed 
in class.
</p>

<p>
You may work with a partner on this assignment. Both of you must read the
paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf"> Pair Programming</a> and
abide by the ground rules as stated in that paper. The file will have a 
header of the following form:
</p><pre>#  File: ExpressionTree.py

#  Description:

#  Student's Name:

#  Student's UT EID:

#  Partner's Name:

#  Partner's UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E 

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting your
program (from both accounts) but make sure that you have your partner's
name and eid in your program. If you are working alone, then remove the
two lines that has the partner's name and eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>ExpressionTree.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Friday, 15 Nov 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p><ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run on the command line before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
