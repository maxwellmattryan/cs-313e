<h3> Baby Names (due 13 Sep 2019) </h3>
<p>
Complete a program that allows a user to query a data base of the 1000 
most popular baby names in the United States per decade for the past 11 
decades under the constraints described below. As always, you may add 
helper functions and should do so to provide structure to the program and 
reduce redundancy. One additional constraint: You must use a <i>Dictionary</i> 
in the solution. You are encouraged to use functions in the <i>String, List</i>
and <i>Dictionary</i> classes to make the program easier to write. The
<i>Dictionary</i> class has lots of functions that can make your job 
easier and one of the goals of this assignment is to learn those functions. 
</p>

<p>
Your program will be processing a file with data obtained from the Social 
Security Administration. They provide a web site showing the distribution 
of names chosen for children over the last 100 years in the US
(<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/">www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/</a>).
</p>

<p>
The data represent the 1000 most popular boy and girl names for children born 
in the US going back to 1900. The data can be boiled down to a single text file
as shown below. On each line we have the name, followed by the rank of that name
in 1900, 1910, 1920, ..., 2000 (11 numbers). A rank of 1 was the most popular 
name that year, while a rank of 997 was not very popular. A 0 means the name 
did not appear in the top 1000 that year at all. The lines are in alphabetical 
order.
</p>

<p>
...<br>
Sam 58 69 99 131 168 236 278 380 467 408 466<br>
Samantha 0 0 0 0 0 0 272 107 26 5 7<br>
Samara 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 886<br>
Samir 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 920 0 798<br>
Sammie 537 545 351 325 333 396 565 772 930 0 0<br>
Sammy 0 887 544 299 202 262 321 395 575 639 755<br>
Samson 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 915<br>
Samuel 31 41 46 60 61 71 83 61 52 35 28<br>
Sandi 0 0 0 0 704 864 621 695 0 0 0<br>
Sandra 0 942 606 50 6 12 11 39 94 168 257<br>
...
</p>

<p>
Note, a 0 in the data file means the name was not ranked in the top 1000 
for the corresponding decade. It has some unknown rank greater than 1000. When 
you store a 0 from the data file in your Dictionary objects you may use 
something other than 0 if you think it will make your algorithms easier to 
implement. (Recall altering the way data is stored to fit our needs is part of 
the magic of programming.)
</p>

<p>
We see that <i>Sam</i> was #58 in 1900 and is slowly moving down. 
<i>Samantha</i> is moving up strong to #7. <i>Samir</i> barely appears in 
1980, but by 2000 is up to #798. The database is for children born in the
US, so ethnic trends show up when immigrants have kids.

<p>
<b>Suggested steps for implementing the program.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>0.</b> Create an empty dictionary to hold the baby names. Open the 
file <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/names.txt"> names.txt </a> and read each line of
data. The baby names become the key and the rankings are stored in a
list that becomes the value. You may store a rank of a 0 as 1001.
</p>

<p>
<b>1.</b> Create a loop in which you display the menu choices. Read
the user's choice and call a function to perform the necessary action.
If the user chooses to quit, break out of the loop.
</p>

<p>
<b>2.</b> Write a function that returns <i>True</i> if a name exists
in the dictionary and <i>False</i> otherwise.
</p>

<p>
<b>3.</b> Write a function that returns all the rankings for a given
name.
</p>

<p>
<b>4.</b> Write a function that returns a list of names that have
a rank in all the decades in sorted order by name.
</p>

<p>
<b>5.</b> Write a function that displays all the names that have a
rank in a given decade in order of rank.
</p>

<p>
<b>6.</b> Write a function to display all names that are getting more
popular in every decade. We must be sure that the popularity is increasing. 
In particular, if we have two 0s, we do not know for sure which one is
less popular. But if we have only one 0 we know it is less popular than
any other entry. This means that 0 (if present) must only be there for
the first decade. The output must be sorted by name.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.</b> Write a function to display all names that are getting less
popular in every decade. We must be sure that the popularity is
decreasing. In particular, if we have two 0s, we do not know for sure
which one is less popular. But if we have one 0 then we know that it
is less popular than any other entry. This means 0 can only be present
in the last decade (if there is any 0). The output must be sorted by
name.
</p>

<p>The menu choices are: </p>

<ol>
<li> to search for names.</li>
<li> to display data for one name.</li>
<li> to display all names that appear in one decade.</li>
<li> to display all names that appear in all decades.</li>
<li> to display all names that are more popular in every decade.</li>
<li> to display all names that are less popular in every decade.</li>
<li> to quit</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/nameSurferLog.txt"> sample output </a> is shown. Some
of the output may not adhere strictly to the constraints that we have
specified above.
</p>

<p>
<b>8.</b> You must use <i>try-except-finally</i> block in your code. You 
will read the file <i>names.txt</i> locally. After you have read in a line 
from the file you may have to change the encoding to <i>utf8</i>.
</p><pre>line = str (line, encoding = 'utf8')
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
<b>
You must complete this assignment on your own. You may not acquire from 
another person or the internet a partial or complete solution to this
assignment. You may not have another person (other than the instructor, 
TAs, or proctors) walk you through the solution. You may only discuss 
general ideas and approaches with other students but you may not develop 
code together.
</b>
</p>

<p>
You will submit the file <i>BabyNames.py</i>. We will be looking at good 
documentation, design, and adherence to coding conventions. Your code 
must have the following header:
</p><pre>
#  File: BabyNames.py 

#  Description:  

#  Student Name:  

#  Student UT EID:  

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:

</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>BabyNames.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Friday, 13 Sep 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p><ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>

This assignment is based on an assignment created by Nick Parlante and Stuart
Reges and modified by Mike Scott. Nick Parlante got the idea for this 
assignment from an article by Peggy Orenstein in the New York Times, 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/magazine/where-have-all-the-lisas-gone.html">
Where have all the Lisas Gone?</a>
