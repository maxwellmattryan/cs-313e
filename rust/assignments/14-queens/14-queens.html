<h3> Eight Queens Problem ( Due 21 Oct 2019 ) </h3>
<p> 
The Eight Queens Problem is a fairly old problem that has been well
discussed and researched. The first published reference to this
problem was in a German Chess magazine in 1848 by Max Bezzel. In
1850, Franz Nauck published all 92 solutions of the problem for
an 8x8 board. S. Gunther in 1874 suggested a method for finding 
solutions by using determinants and J.W.L. Glaisher extended this
method. E. Dijkstra published a detailed description of the
solution of the problem as a depth-first backtracking algorithm.
</p>

<p>
The original statement of the problem ran as follows - how can we
place eight queens on a regular chess board such that no queen can
capture another. It turns out there is no unique solution but 92
possible solutions of which only 12 are distinct. The 12 distinct
solutions can generate all other solutions through reflections and /
or rotations. Here is a table that gives the size of the board, all
possible solutions, and all distinct solutions.
</p>

<table border="1" width="50%">
<tbody><tr><th>Size</th><th> All Solutions </th><th> Distinct Solutions </th></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td> 0 </td><td> 0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> 0 </td><td> 0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td> 2 </td><td> 1 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 5 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 2 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 6 </td><td> 4 </td><td> 1 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 7 </td><td> 40 </td><td> 6 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 8 </td><td> 92 </td><td> 12 </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
This is a classic back-tracking problem and we have discussed the
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/EightQueens.txt"> solution and code </a> in class. The
code that we worked on prints only one possible solution to the
problem. There are several variations to this problem and their
solutions. 
</p>

<p>
Prompt the user to enter the size of the board.
The size of the board must be a number between 1 and 8 inclusive.
Keep prompting the user to enter a number in that range, if he does
not get it right. For the size of the board that the user specified
generate and print <b>all</b> possible solutions for that size. Keep 
a count of the number of solutions and your last line should print
the total number. Here is a possible scenario:
</p><pre>Enter the size of board: 4

* Q * *
* * * Q
Q * * *
* * Q *

* * Q *
Q * * *
* * * Q
* Q * *

There are 2 solutions for a 4 x 4 board.

For grading purposes, your prompt should end in a colon character then a
space character (': '). Do not place any colons in any other places in any
prompt or printed output. Matching the provided sample prompt will expedite
grading.

<p>
The file that you will be turning in will be called <b> Queens.py</b>.
We are looking for clean and structured design. The file will have a 
header of the following form:
</p><pre>#  File: Queens.py

#  Description:

#  Student Name:

#  Student UT EID:

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting the same
program (from both accounts) but make sure that you have your partner's
name and eid in your program. If you are working alone, then remove the
two lines that has the partner's name and eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>Queens.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Monday, 21 Oct 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
