<h3> Basic Geometry (Due 20 Sep 2019) </h3>
<p>
This assignment is on object oriented programming. You will be developing
several classes that are fundamental in Geometry - Point, Circle, and
Rectangle. In main() you will test the various functions that you have 
written for the classes. <b>Do not change the names of the methods, 
attributes, or arguments.</b> You may write as many helper functions as
needed.
</p>

<p>
Here is the skeleton of the code that we started writing in class. Write
the bodies of the functions that we did not complete. You can always add
more functions.
</p>

<pre>import math

class Point (object):
  # constructor 
  # x and y are floats
  def __init__ (self, x = 0, y = 0):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y

  # get distance
  # other is a Point object
  def dist (self, other):
    return math.hypot (self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)

  # get a string representation of a Point object
  # takes no arguments
  # returns a string
  def __str__ (self):
    return '(' + str(self.x) + ", " + str(self.y) + ")"

  # test for equality
  # other is a Point object
  # returns a Boolean
  def __eq__ (self, other):
    tol = 1.0e-8
    return ((abs (self.x - other.x) &lt; tol) and (abs(self.y - other.y) &lt; tol))

class Circle (object):
  # constructor
  # x, y, and radius are floats
  def __init__ (self, radius = 1, x = 0, y = 0):
    self.radius = radius
    self.center = Point (x, y)

  # compute cirumference
  def circumference (self):
    return 2.0 * math.pi * self.radius

  # compute area
  def area (self):
    return math.pi * self.radius * self.radius

  # determine if point is strictly inside circle
  def point_inside (self, p):
    return (self.center.dist(p) &lt; self.radius)

  # determine if a circle is strictly inside this circle
  def circle_inside (self, c):
    distance = self.center.dist (c.center)
    return (distance + c.radius) &lt; self.radius

  # determine if a circle c overlaps this circle (non-zero area of overlap)
  # but neither is completely inside the other
  # the only argument c is a Circle object
  # returns a boolean
  def circle_overlap (self, c):
   
  # determine the smallest circle that circumscribes a rectangle
  # the circle goes through all the vertices of the rectangle
  # the only argument, r, is a rectangle object
  def circle_circumscribe (self, r):

  # string representation of a circle
  # takes no arguments and returns a string
  def __str__ (self):
    return "Radius: " + str(self.radius) + ", Center: " + str(self.center)
    
  # test for equality of radius
  # the only argument, other, is a circle
  # returns a boolean
  def __eq__ (self, other):
    tol = 1.0e-8

class Rectangle (object):
  # constructor
  def __init__ (self, ul_x = 0, ul_y = 1, lr_x = 1, lr_y = 0):
    if ((ul_x &lt; lr_x) and (ul_y &gt; lr_y)):
      self.ul = Point (ul_x, ul_y)
      self.lr = Point (lr_x, lr_y)
    else:
      self.ul = Point (0, 1)
      self.lr = Point (1, 0)

  # determine length of Rectangle (distance along the x axis)
  # takes no arguments, returns a float
  def length (self):

  def rectangle_circumscribe (self, c):

  # give string representation of a rectangle

  def __str__ (self):
    return "UL: " + str(self.ul) + ", LR: " + str(self.lr)

  # determine if two rectangles have the same length and width
  # takes a rectangle other as argument and returns a boolean
  def __eq__ (self, other):

def main():
  # open the file geom.txt

<p>
Note that in this program you will be checking for the equality of 
two floating point numbers. Since there is a finite precision in the 
representation of floating point numbers, it is not always possible 
to determine exact equality. A working solution is to determine 
equality is to take the absolute value of the difference of the 
floating point numbers and see if the difference is less than a 
pre-determined tolerance. This tolerance is arbitrary and is often 
dictated by the problem that you are trying to solve. Here is a 
function that tests for equality of two floating point numbers. 
</p><pre>def is_equal (a, b):
  tol = 1.0e-8
  return (abs (x - y) &lt; tol)
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You will be reading your input from the file <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/geom.txt">
geom.txt</a>. The format of the file will be exactly like this:
</p><pre>-3.0 2.0                           # coordinates of P
2.0 -1.0                           # coordinates of Q
1.0 3.0 2.0                        # radius and center of C
5.0 -2.0 -3.0                      # radius and center of D
2.0 6.0 8.0 4.0                    # coord ul and lr of rectangle G
-3.0 2.0 4.0 -3.0                  # coord ul and lr of rectangle H
</pre>
The structure of your output will be as follows:
<pre>Coordinates of P:
Coordinates of Q: 
Distance between P and Q:
Circle C:
Circle D:
Circumference of C:
Area of D:
P (is / is not) inside C
C (is / is not) inside D
C (does / does not) intersect D
C (is / is not) equal to D
Rectangle G:
Rectangle H:
Length of G:
Width of H:
Perimeter of G:
Area of H:
P (is / is not) inside G
G (is / is not) inside H
G (does / does not ) overlap H
Circle that circumscribes G:
Rectangle that circumscribes D:
Rectangle G (is / is not) equal to H
</pre>

<p>
For this assignment you may work with a partner. Both of you
must read the paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf">
Pair Programming. </a>.
</p>

<p>
The file that you will be turning in will be called <b> Geom.py</b>.
We are looking for clean and structured design. The file will have a 
header of the following form:
</p><pre>#  File: Geom.py

#  Description:

#  Student Name:

#  Student UT EID:

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting the
same program from both accounts, but make sure that you have your partner's
name and eid in your program. If you are working alone, then remove the
two lines that has the partner's name and eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>Geom.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Friday, 20 Sep 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
</ul>
