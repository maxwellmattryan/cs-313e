<h3> Word Search ( Due 16 Sep 2019 ) </h3>
<p> 
Given an <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> grid of letters, and a list of words,
find the location in the grid where the word can be found. A word
matches a straight, contiguous line of letters in the grid. The match
could either be done horizontally (left or right) or vertically (up
or down) or along any diagonal either right to left or from left to
right.
</p>

<p>
The input will be in a file called 
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/hidden.txt"><i>hidden.txt</i></a> and your output
will be written to a file called 
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/found.txt"><i>found.txt</i></a>. The format of the
input file will be as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>First line will have two integers - m, the number of lines in the
grid and n, the number of characters in each line. The integers <i>m</i>
and <i>n</i> will be separated by one or more spaces. </li>
<li>There will be a single blank line. </li>
<li>There will be <i>m</i> lines, where each line will have  <i>n</i>
characters, all in upper case, separated by a space. </li>
<li> There will be a single blank line. </li>
<li> There will be a single integer <i>k</i>, denoting the number of
words that follow. </li>
<li> There will be <i>k</i> lines. Each line will contain a single word
in all uppercase. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
There will be <i>k</i> lines in your output file. Each line will have
the word that you are to search followed by two integers <i>i</i> and 
<i>j</i> separated by one or more spaces. The numbers will be right 
justified and aligned. The number <i>i</i> gives the row and the number 
<i>j</i> the column of the <b>first</b> letter of the word that you were 
required to find. Rows and columns are numbered conventionally, i.e. the 
first row is 1 and the first column is 1. If you do not find a word in 
the grid then the values for <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> will be <i>0</i> and 
<i>0</i>. Use the full power of the built-in functions associated with 
strings and lists. 
</p>

<p>
For this assignment you may work with a partner. Both of you
must read the paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf">
Pair Programming. </a>.
</p>

<p>
The file that you will be turning in will be called <b> WordSearch.py</b>.
The file will have a header of the following form:
</p><pre>
#  File: WordSearch.py

#  Description:

#  Student Name:

#  Student UT EID:

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E 

#  Unique Number:

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:

</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting
the same program from both accounts but make sure that you have 
your partner's name and eid in your program. If you are working 
alone, then remove the two lines that has the partner's name and 
eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> program to 
submit your <b>WordSearch.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Monday, 16 Sep 2019. We will be looking for clean logic and
good documentation. There will be substantial penalties if you do not 
adhere to the guidelines. 
</p><ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the header with the proper 
     documentation. </li>
<li> Your code must run before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
</ul>
