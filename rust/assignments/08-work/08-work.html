<title> Programming Assignment 8 </title>

<h3> Work Till You Drop (due 30 Sep 2019) </h3>
<p>
Vyasa has to complete a programming assignment overnight. He has to
write n lines of code before morning. He is dead tired and he tries
drinking some black coffee to keep him awake. But each time he drinks
a cup of coffee he stays awake for a short amount of time but his 
productivity goes down by a constant factor <i>k</i>
</p>

<p>
This is how he plans to write the program. He will write the first
<i>v</i> lines of code, then drink his first cup of coffee. Since his
productivity has gone down by a factor of <i>k</i> he will write 
<i>v // k</i> lines of code. He will have another cup of coffee and 
then write <i>v // k**2</i> lines of code. He will have another cup
of coffee and write <i>v // k**3</i> lines of code and so on. He will
collapse and fall asleep  when <i>v // k ** p</i> becomes 0. 
</p>

<p>
Now Vyasa does want to complete his assignment and maximize on his
sleep. So he wants to figure out the minimum allowable value of 
<i>v</i> for a given productivity factor that will allow him to
write at least n lines of code before he falls asleep.
</p>

<p>
Your input file will be called <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/work.txt"> work.txt</a>.
Here is a typical file:
</p><pre>2
7 2
59 9
</pre>
The first line is <i>T</i> the number of test cases. This will be
followed by <i>T</i> lines of input. Each line of input will have
two numbers <i>n</i> and <i>k</i>. <i>n</i> is the number of lines
of code to write and <i>k</i> is the productivity factor, where
1 &#8804; n &#8804; 10<sup>6</sup> and 2 &#8804; k &#8804; 10.
<p></p>

<p>
For each test case your output to the screen will be <i>v</i> lines
of code the Vyasa has to write. For the above two test cases, the
output will be:
</p><pre>4
54
</pre>
You have to modify the binary search algorithm to solve this problem.

<p>
<b>
You must complete this assignment on your own. You may not acquire from 
another person or the internet a partial or complete solution to this
assignment. You may not show another student your solution to an
assignment. You may not have another person (other than the instructor, TAs,
or proctors) walk you through the solution. You may only discuss general
ideas and approaches with other students but you may not develop code
together.
</b>
</p>

<p>
You will submit the file <i>Work.py</i>. We will be looking at good 
documentation, design, and adherence to coding conventions. Your code 
must have the following header:
</p><pre>
#  File: Work.py 

#  Description:  

#  Student Name:  

#  Student UT EID:  

#  Course Name: CS 313E
