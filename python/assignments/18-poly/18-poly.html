<h3> Linked List Representation of Polynomials ( Due 11 Nov 2019 ) </h3>
<p>
A polynomial is of the form: <br><br>

a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + a<sub>n - 1</sub>x<sup>n - 1</sup> + 
… + a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>1</sup> + a<sub>0</sub>x<sup>0</sup>
<br><br>
We are going to assume that the polynomials that we will be 
representing will have integer coefficients and exponents. The 
coefficients can be positive or negative. The zero-coefficient
terms are not shown in the polynomial expression. The exponents
are zero or greater.
</p>

<p>
In this assignment you will represent a polynomial as a Linked List.
You will redefine the Link class and then work on the Linked List
class. You will implement two main arithmetical functions on polynomials
- addition and multiplication. You may add as many helper functions
as needed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Input: </b> You will read input from a file <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/poly.txt">
poly.txt</a>. You will have data for just two polynomials separated by
a single blank line. The first line of data will be <i>n</i> the number 
of terms in the first polynomial having non-zero coefficients. It will
be followed by <i>n</i> lines of data. Each line having two integers
separated by two or more spaces. The first integer will be the coefficient
and the second integer will be the exponent. It will be followed by blank 
line. This will be followed by a single integer <i>m</i> representing the 
number of non-zero coefficient terms in the second polynomial. It will be 
followed by <i>m</i> lines. Each line will have two integers separated by
one or more spaces representing the coefficient and exponent.
</p>

<p>
<b>Output: </b> Your output will be the sum and product of the two
polynomials in the following format:
</p><pre>Sum: (3, 4) + (3, 3) + (5, 2) + (-6, 1) + (2, 0)

Product: (15, 7) + (-10, 6) + (7, 5) + (18, 4) + (-34, 3) + (10, 2)
</pre>
Both the sum and the product will be in descending order of the
exponents. There should not be any zero coefficient term in the
output.
<p></p>

<p>
Here is the template of the code:
</p><pre>class Link (object):
  def __init__ (self, coeff = 1, exp = 1, next = None):
    self.coeff = coeff
	self.exp = exp
	self.next = next

  def __str__ (self):
    return '(' + str (self.coeff) + ', ' + str (self.exp) + ')'

class LinkedList (object):
  def __init__ (self):
    self.first = None

  # keep Links in descending order of exponents
  def insert_in_order (self, coeff, exp):

  # add polynomial p to this polynomial and return the sum
  def add (self, p):

  # multiply polynomial p to this polynomial and return the product
  def mult (self, p):

  # create a string representation of the polynomial
  def __str_ (self):

def main():
  # open file poly.txt for reading

  # create polynomial p

  # create polynomial q

  # get sum of p and q and print sum

  # get product of p and q and print product

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
For this assignment you may work with a partner. Both of you
must read the paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf">
Pair Programming. </a>.
</p>

<p>
The file that you will be uploading will be called <b> Poly.py</b>.
We are looking for clean and structured design. The file will have a 
header of the following form:
</p><pre>#  File: Poly.py

#  Description:

#  Student Name:

#  Student UT EID:

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting your
program (from both accounts) but make sure that you have your partner's
name and eid in your program. If you are working alone, then remove the
two lines that has the partner's name and eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>Poly.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Monday, 11 Nov 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run on the command line before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
</ul>
