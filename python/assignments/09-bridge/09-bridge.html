<h3> Crossing the Bridge (due 04 Oct 2019) </h3>
<p>
There are <i>n</i> people who wish to cross a bridge at night. At most
two people can cross the bridge at the same time. There is only one
flashlight and they need the flashlight to cross the bridge. So the
flashlight has to be brought over to the starting side so that more
people can cross. 
</p>

<p>
Each person has a different crossing speed that determines the time
that person would take to cross the bridge. The speed of a group is
determined by the slowest member. You will have to design and code
an algorithm that will determine the shortest time to cross the
bridge for the <i>n</i> people under the constraints mentioned.
</p>

<p>
<b>Input</b><br>
The input will be in a file called <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/bridge.txt"> bridge.txt
</a>. The input file begins with a single positive integer on a line
by itself that indicates the number of cases that follow. This line
is followed by a blank line, and there is a blank line between two
consecutive cases.
</p>

<p>
The first line of each case contains <i>n</i>, the number of people
that will be crossing. This is followed by <i>n</i> lines each giving
the time taken by a person to cross the bridge. Assume that <i>n</i>
will never be greater than 20 and the times will be less than 60.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ouptut </b><br>
Your output will be the minimum time for each case separated by a 
blank line.

<p>
You will submit the file <i>Bridge.py</i>. We will be looking at good 
documentation, design, and adherence to coding conventions. Your code 
must have the following header:
</p><pre>
#  File: Bridge.py 

#  Description:  

#  Student Name:  

#  Student UT EID:  

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
For this assignment you may work with a partner. Both of you
must read the paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf">
Pair Programming. </a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting the
same program from both accounts but make sure that you have your partner's
name and eid in your program. If you are working alone, then remove the
two lines that has the partner's name and eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>Bridge.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Friday, 04 Oct 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p><ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
</ul>
