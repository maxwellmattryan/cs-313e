<h3> Topological Sort ( Due 02 Dec 2019 ) </h3>
<p>
In this assignment you will be creating a graph from an input gif
file called <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/dag.gif"> dag.gif</a>. You will complete
the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/topo.txt">topo.txt</a> file. 
</p>

<p>
The first line in that file will be a single integer <i>v</i>. 
This number will denote the number of vertices to follow. The next 
<i>v</i> lines will be the labels for the vertices in alphabetical
order. There will be one label to a line. The labels are unique. The 
next line after the labels for vertices will be a single number 
<i>e</i>. This number will denote the number of edges to follow. 
There will be one edge per line. Each edge will be of the form - 
fromVertex and toVertex. Assign a default weight of 1 to each edge. 
</p>

<p>
Here is the outline of the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/Graph.py.txt">code</a> that 
we developed in class that you will be modifying. You will use 
<i>topo.txt</i> instead of <i>graph.txt</i> as your input file. You 
can add an Edge class if you want to. You may use any of the functions 
that you wrote for the GraphTraversal class in your last assignment. You 
can add more functions as needed. You will first test if the given Graph 
does not contain a cycle and then do a topological sort on that Graph. 
For your output, the vertices on a given level must be printed in 
alphabetical order.
</p>

<pre>class Graph (object):
  # determine if a directed graph has a cycle
  # this function should return a boolean and not print the result
  def has_cycle (self):

  # return a list of vertices after a topological sort
  # this function should not print the list
  def toposort (self):

def main():
  # test if a directed graph has a cycle

  # test topological sort

main()
</pre>

<p>
For this assignment you may work with a partner. Both of you
must read the paper on <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/PairProg-CACM-1999.pdf">
Pair Programming. </a>.
</p>

<p>
The file that you will be uploading will be called <b> TopoSort.py</b>.
We are looking for clean and structured design. The file will have a 
header of the following form:
</p><pre>#  File: TopoSort.py

#  Description:

#  Student Name:

#  Student UT EID:

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:

</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting your
program (from both accounts) but make sure that you have your partner's
name and eid in your program. If you are working alone, then remove the
two lines that has the partner's name and eid in the header.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="http://canvas.utexas.edu/"> Canvas </a> system to 
submit your <b>TopoSort.py</b> file. We should receive your work by 
11 PM on Monday, 02 Dec 2019. There will be substantial penalties if 
you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive.  
The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Your Python program should have the proper header. </li>
<li> Your code must run on the command line before submission. </li>
<li> You should be submitting your file through the web based 
     <i>Canvas</i> program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.</li>
<li> Here is the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mitra/csFall2019/cs313/assgn/grading.html"> Grading Criteria. </a></li>
</ul>
